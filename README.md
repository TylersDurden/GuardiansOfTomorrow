# The Guardians Of Tommorrow
**A Science Fiction Novel by Tom Robbins**

## The Rise of Veratta
Within the Xerxes Galaxy, on one of the outer arms known as Nara-Mu, had once resided an ancient and powerful race. 
Through the eons, they evolved and ultimately shed their corporeal existence, forming an even 
more influential and collective intelligence. It became necessary for these ancient ones to traverse to another plane of
existence and, before leaving, choose one world to safeguard their legacy. No one knew this small isolated planet in the
Agares constellation would have immeasurable capabilities left to their devices.
